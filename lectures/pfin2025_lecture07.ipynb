    "    *   Scenario 1 (Table 1) assumes the firm issues no new net debt (Net Borrowing = 0). All investments beyond what's covered by non-cash charges (like depreciation) effectively reduce FCFE or require new equity.  \n",

    "\n",
    "2.  **Impact on Equity Value ($V_0$):**  \n",
    "    *   Because Scenario 2 has higher FCFEs (due to positive net borrowing), its resulting Equity Value ($V_0 \\approx \\$1{,}643 \\text{ million}$) is higher than the equity value for Scenario 1 ($V_0 \\approx \\$1{,}517 \\text{ million}$), assuming the same cost of equity ($r_E = 13.25\\%$) is used.\n",

    "        *   In Scenario 1 (Net Borrowing = 0), if the firm has existing debt and equity grows via retained earnings, the D/E ratio will likely decrease over time. This should, theoretically, lead to a decreasing $r_E$. Using a constant $r_E = 13.25\\%$ is a simplification.  \n",
    "        *   In Scenario 2 (Net Borrowing to maintain D/V = 40% for new investments), if this policy leads to the overall firm D/V ratio converging to and stabilizing at 40%, then an $r_E$ appropriate for a 40% D/V firm is more consistent.  \n",
